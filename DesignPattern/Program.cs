   - Design Patterns are reusable solutions to the problems that as a developer we encounter in our day to day programming. 
   - Design Patterns are basically used to solve the problems of object generation and integration. 
   
   Types Of Design Pattern:
    1. Creational Design Pattern (object creation and initialization)
    2. Structural Design Pattern (Structural Changes of class and interfaces, and the relationship between classes)
    3. Behavioral Design Pattern (Communication Between Objects)

   Creational Design Patterns:
   - The Creational Design Pattern deals with Object Creation and Initialization.
   - Examples of Creational design patterns are 
           - Factory
           - Factory Method
           - Abstract Factory
           - Builder 
           - Fluent Interface
           - Prototype
           - Singleton

   Structural Design Patterns: 
   - The Structural Design Pattern is basically used to manage the structure of classes and interface as well as manage the relationship between the classes.
   - Examples of Structural Design Patterns category: 
            - Adapter
            - Facade
            - Decorator
            - Composite
            - Proxy
            - Flyweight
            - Bridge Design Pattern

   Behavioral Design Patterns: 
   - The Behavioral Design Patterns deal with the communication between Classes and objects.
   - Examples of Behavioral design patterns: 
            - Chain of Responsibility
            - Command
            - Observer
            - Iterator
            - State
            - Template Method
            - Visitor
            - Strategy
            - Mediator
            - Memento
            - Interpreter Design Pattern
